//! Bounded, overflow-safe oracle-price conversion for CraftNexus (Issue #1088).
//!
//! # Problem
//!
//! Any settlement path that turns an oracle price into a transferable amount
//! is a value-creation surface: a stale or manipulated price, a fat-fingered
//! decimals mismatch, or a plain `i128` overflow can mint or burn value that
//! never existed in the escrowed pot. This module is the single place that
//! turns `(amount, price)` into a converted amount, and it never returns a
//! value that has not passed every configured economic bound.
//!
//! # Fixed-point representation
//!
//! Prices follow the same convention as the Stellar/Soroban reflector oracle
//! interface: a price is an `i128` mantissa scaled by `10^decimals`. For
//! example a price of `1.2345` with `decimals = 7` is represented as the
//! mantissa `12_345_000`.
//!
//! # Rounding direction
//!
//! Every conversion **truncates toward zero** (floor division on the
//! non-negative operands this module accepts). This is documented per party
//! because it determines who absorbs the fractional remainder:
//!
//! - [`convert_amount`] (buyer pays seller's asset, or any forward quote):
//!   rounds down. The **receiving party** (the party this amount is paid
//!   *to*) gets the truncated, smaller amount; the payer never pays more
//!   than the true converted value. This prevents a rounding-up path from
//!   ever manufacturing value out of the fee/refund pot.
//! - [`convert_amount_ceiling`] (used when the contract must not *underpay*
//!   an obligation it owes, e.g. computing how much input is required to
//!   guarantee a minimum output): rounds up, so the **payer** covers the
//!   full obligation and the contract is never left short.
//!
//! Callers must pick the direction that matches which side of the trade the
//! contract is protecting; see each function's doc comment.
//!
//! # Conservation
//!
//! Because both rounding helpers are pure functions of `(amount, price)` with
//! no hidden state, converting an escrow's `platform_fee`, `seller_amount`,
//! and `buyer_amount` independently and summing them can differ from
//! converting the total by at most `(number of parts - 1)` units of the
//! output asset (integer-division remainder loss). Conversion call sites
//! that must preserve exact conservation (fee + seller + buyer == total)
//! should convert the total once and derive the parts from the *converted*
//! total using the existing basis-point split, rather than converting each
//! part independently.
