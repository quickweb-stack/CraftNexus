    ///    period both parties may submit or rebut evidence. `resolve_dispute` is
    ///    blocked until the window has elapsed (see [`Self::resolve_dispute`]).
    /// 2. **Escalation window** (`dispute_escalation_window`): after this period
    ///    either party may call `escalate_dispute` to flag the dispute as stalled
    ///    and surface it to priority queues (see [`Self::escalate_dispute`]).
    /// 3. **Maximum duration** (`max_dispute_duration`): if the arbitrator has not
    ///    resolved the dispute before this deadline, anyone can call

    /// evidence and reached a decision. It must be called **after** the evidence
    /// challenge window (`evidence_challenge_window`) has elapsed, ensuring both
    /// parties had a fair opportunity to submit and rebut evidence before the
    /// decision is locked in (see `dispute_escrow` for the full state diagram).
    ///
    /// If the arbitrator does not act before `max_dispute_duration` expires, any
    /// party can force-close the dispute via `resolve_expired_dispute` instead.
    ///
    /// ## Authorization
    ///
    /// Callable by the platform `admin`, the designated `arbitrator`, or any
    /// configured `moderator`. Parties to the escrow (buyer/seller) cannot call
    /// this function directly — they can only influence the outcome through
    /// evidence submission or `propose_partial_refund`.
    ///
    /// ## CEI pattern (Checks → Effects → Interactions)
    ///
    /// To prevent reentrancy attacks this function follows the CEI pattern strictly:
    ///
    /// 1. **Checks** — verify status, authorization, and the evidence window.
    /// 2. **Effects** — update `escrow.status` to `Resolved` and persist all
    ///    storage writes (dispute counter, obligation counters, contract counters,
    ///    orphaned refund-proposal cleanup) **before** any token transfer.
    /// 3. **Interactions** — execute the token transfer as the very last step.
    ///
    /// If the token transfer reverts (e.g. the recipient's trustline was revoked),
    /// Soroban's atomic execution rolls back all storage writes and the escrow
    /// stays in `Disputed` so the arbitrator can retry with a different resolution.
    ///
